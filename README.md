How to build asterisk rpms on Centos 7

I created these files when i need to install asterisk-13 at CentOS server.
I dont find any repository with ready spec files, so i created them.

mostly borrowed from https://github.com/pld-linux/asterisk/
i adopted specs to centos

it is very simple asterisk build, because i need just simple pbx
